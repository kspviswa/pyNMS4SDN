Lot of major / global players, had started to migrate their legacy networking\r\nsystems / components to software defined eco-system.  NMS has been a key component, that sits on managment plane. However, there\r\nis no SDN implementation of complete NMS system (FCAPS functionalities).\r\n\r\npyNMS4SDN is an attempt to implement NMS for SDN systems, primary based on *REST API URLS* of SDN controller, that primary monitors & controls the network.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Complete FCAPS functionality [Fault tolerance, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security].\r\n* Fully implemented in *pure* python.\r\n* GUI based. Easy to use & administer.\r\n* Configuration driven - Able to operate on any SDN controller (as long of mgmt hooks available)\r\n\r\n### Dependency\r\n\r\n* tKinter GUI library\r\n* pysnmp\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\nVenkata Narayana Tata / kspviswa\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
